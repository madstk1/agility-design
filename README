# Simplicity Design
Simplicity Design is a mobile-first HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework to create themed websites. While it is influenced by Bootstrap 4 and Foundation, it also combines different aspects into a more uniform framework.

## Getting Started

To start using SD, simply link the `.css`-file to your `.html`-file.

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madstk1/simplicity-design/master/css/simplicity-design.min.css">
  
To add a skin, link the skin-in-questions's `.css`-file to your `.html`-file, as well.
